## Scraping 
using selph's scraper: https://github.com/sselph/scraper

### Arcade
- Run the following commands in an arcade system's folder (i.e. /roms/mame-libretro, /roms/fba): 
- First Scrape Flyers (from theGamesDB): /opt/retropie/supplementary/scraper/scraper -mame=true -mame_src=gdb,adb,ss -mame_img=fly,b,t,s -max_height=540 -max_width=394 -image_dir=media -image_path=media
- Then if you want Videos and Marquees (from ScreenScraper) run this: /opt/retropie/supplementary/scraper/scraper -mame=true -mame_src=ss,gdb,adb -download_videos=true -download_marquees=true -image_dir=media -image_path=media -video_dir=media -video_path=media -marquee_dir=media -marquee_path=media

### Console

- Run this command in a system's folder (i.e. /roms/nes): /opt/retropie/supplementary/scraper/scraper -console_src=ss -max_height=540 -max_width=505 -download_videos=true -download_marquees=true -image_dir=media -image_path=media -video_dir=media -video_path=media -marquee_dir=media -marquee_path=media -use_nointro_name=false 
- Notes: 
- If you only want images (no video/marquee) then you can modfiy the command to this: /opt/retropie/supplementary/scraper/scraper -console_src=ss -max_height=540 -max_width=505 image_dir=media -image_path=media -use_nointro_name=false 
- If you want higher quality art, add -img_format=png to the end of the command (that will download pngs instead of jpgs but will also result in larger filesizes - which may add lag if you are on a pi0)

### Game & Watch

- Run this command in the /roms/gameandwatch folder: /opt/retropie/supplementary/scraper/scraper -console_src=ss -console_img=clabel,b,s -img_format=png -max_height=540 -max_width=505 -image_dir=media -image_path=media
